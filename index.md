I'm an interdisciplinary researcher with expertise in information theory, computational imaging, deep learning, biology, and software engineering. I did my PhD and postdoc in the UC Berkeley <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/">EECS</a> department and <a href="https://bair.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley AI Research Lab</a>, advised by <a href="http://www.laurawaller.com/">Laura Waller</a>.

<p>My research has included:</p>

<ul>
<li>Inventing a technique to design cameras and other sensors for AI rather than human vision</li>
<li>Building the ARC-AGI-2 benchmark for testing fluid intelligence in large language models</li>
<li>Creating a 12-million-image biomedical dataset to train computer vision algorithms</li>
<li>Producing the most widely used software for automating microscopes, used in applications from diagnosing disease to discovering new materials</li>
<li>Developing neural network architectures that incorporate physics knowledge to enable fast and low-cost scientific discovery</li>
</ul>
