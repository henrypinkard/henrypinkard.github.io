<p>I am a Ph.D. student in <a href="https://ccb.berkeley.edu/academics/phd-in-computational-biology/" >Computational Biology</a> at UC Berkeley, where I work in the <a href="http://www.laurawaller.com/">Computational Imaging Lab</a> with Prof. Laura Waller in the <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/">Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences.</a> I am also the founder of Photomics, Inc.
	<!-- <a href="https://photomics.ai/">Photomics, Inc.</a>  -->
</p> 

<p>My research is focused on the design of hardware, software, and algorithms for new types of data-driven microscopy. As a result, I work at the intersection of many fields, including optical physics, machine learning, single-cell biology, immunology, software engineering, data science, computer vision, and information theory.


<p>
Before coming to UC Berkeley, I spent 3 years the UCSF <a href="https://bidc.ucsf.edu/">Biological Imaging Development Center</a> with Prof. Matthew Krummel, where I built and programmed microscopes and did research on the immune system. Before that, I worked in <a href="https://valelab.ucsf.edu/">Prof. Ron Vale's lab</a> at UCSF where I helped develop an open source software for microscope control called <a href="https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Micro-Manager_Open_Source_Microscopy_Software">Micro-Manager</a>, which I've continued working on in the decade since.</p> 


<p>My graduate work has been funded by fellowships from the <a href="https://bids.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Institute for Data Science</a>, the <a href="https://bakarinstitute.ucsf.edu/">UCSF Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute</a>, and the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/">NSF</a>.
